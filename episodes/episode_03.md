## Episode 3: Echoes in the Crimson Dust

**Logline:** Ten years after the Collapse, a salvage team investigating a derelict mining colony uncovers a cryptic signal and a dangerous secret linked to the vanished “Whisper Carriers,” forcing a fractured alliance to confront a resurgence of ancient, technologically advanced Martian tribes.

**Scene 1:** INT. SALVAGE SHIP - NIGHT

SOUND: Low humming of machinery, rhythmic grinding of metal

The interior of a battered salvage ship, *The Serpent’s Coil*, is dimly lit. Rain lashes against the reinforced viewport. Jax (40s, grizzled, hardened) meticulously examines data on a holographic display, scanning geological surveys. Across the room, Lena (30s, sharp, analytical) meticulously checks thermal scans. Liam (20s, eager, idealistic) is attempting to repair a damaged communication array.

JAX
(Without looking up)
Still nothing. No terrestrial activity in this sector. Just iron, basalt, and a whole lot of dead miners.

LENA
(Scanning)
The geological signature is anomalous. Deep subsurface anomalies, consistent with ancient habitation. And… residue. Unusual atmospheric composition, traces of a compound not registered in the archives.

LIAM
(Grunting)
The array's flickering. Just like the rest of the ship. Makes you wonder if this whole operation feels… hollow, somehow.

JAX
Hollow? We’re searching for relics, Liam. Not ghost towns. The Collapse buried a lot of history, and frankly, a lot of regret.

Suddenly, a burst of static. Lena’s face tightens.

LENA
I've got it. A signal, originating from a sector approximately 200 kilometers west, seemingly locked onto a specific frequency. It's… deliberate.

JAX
(Scoffs)
Deliberate? Signals from the Old Earth? Don’t tell me it’s a simple distress call.

LENA
(Working furiously)
The signal’s complex. It's not just a broadcast. It's… structured. Almost like a language. And it’s repeating a sequence.

Liam, engrossed in repairing the array, looks up.

LIAM
That's… an unknown frequency pattern. I’ve cross-referenced it with historical Martian transmissions - 14th century to early 20th century. Nothing matches.

The holographic display shifts, displaying an image - a stylized, almost geometric image of a vast, pulsating nebula.

**Scene 2:** EXT. KLAXXIS VALLEY - DAY

SOUND: Wind whistles through canyons, the sound of ragged, worn clothing.

The *Serpent’s Coil* is embedded in a narrow, rocky valley. The landscape is brutally beautiful, harsh, and red. Jax, Lena, and Liam, accompanied by a heavily armed security team led by Sergeant Volkov (50s, stern, weathered), navigate a treacherous path.

VOLKOV
(Voice raspy)
The Crimson Dust settled thick a generation ago. Visibility is limited. You're approaching the perimeter of the Klasma Region. Local legends speak of… ‘the echoes.’

Jax stops, scanning the area.

JAX
Legends say the Klasma are connected to something ancient. Something that… remembers.

Lena approaches a large, crumbling structure - a ruined observation post built from volcanic rock. A massive, partially buried antenna dominates the center.

LENA
The analysis confirms it. This is a remnant of the Whisper Carriers. A civilization that predated the Collapse, but whose technology was far more advanced. They weren’t wiped out. They vanished.

Liam examines a weathered, holographic display projected from the antenna. It shows a map of the region, overlaid with red, swirling lines – the ‘Echoes’ – a phenomenon where the area appears to shift and distort.

LIAM
The signal’s strengthening. It’s originating *within* the structure. And it’s… fluctuating. As if it's trying to communicate.

**Scene 3:** INT. KLAXXIS VALLEY - LATER

SOUND: Static crackling, distant guttural chants.

The team has reached a large, underground cavern. Inside, they find evidence of the Whisper Carriers’ civilization - intricate, obsidian-like structures, remnants of a massive, network of tunnels. The Echoes are overwhelming. The air is thick with a low, resonant hum.

VOLKOV
(Pointing a rifle)
Whatever's happening here, it’s destabilizing the rock strata. The ground is shifting.

Suddenly, the holographic display shifts again, this time focusing on a single point within the cavern. It displays a face – a strikingly human face, but impossibly old, almost translucent, with elongated features. It’s a woman, seemingly frozen in a moment of intense emotion.

LENA
(Whispering)
It’s a reconstruction of an individual. A ‘Keeper.’

JAX
(Approaching cautiously)
What happened to her?

As Jax gets closer, the holographic face begins to pulse with a faint, blue light. The Echoes intensify, and a single, cryptic symbol – a stylized spiral – appears on the cavern wall.

**Scene 4:** EXT. KLAXXIS VALLEY - NIGHT

SOUND: Rain, wind, rhythmic chanting – layered and unsettling.

The *Serpent’s Coil* has established a temporary base camp near the cavern entrance. Volkov and Lena are analyzing the fragmented data from the signal. Liam is attempting to establish a secure communication link with a nearby colony.

LENA
The data suggests the Keeper wasn’t wiped out. She was… trapped. A prisoner. Connected to the Echoes through a neurological link.

VOLKOV
(Grimly)
The Collapse wasn't just a disaster. It was a… ritual. A desperate attempt to contain a power far beyond our comprehension. They sought to trap the Echoes, to prevent them from re-emerging.

Liam suddenly turns pale.

LIAM
I’ve been running diagnostics. The signal isn’t just transmitting. It’s… *remembering*. And it’s remembering something horrific. The Whisper Carriers didn't just disappear. They went *into* something. A pocket dimension of pure consciousness.

The holographic face on the wall shifts again, now displaying a single, horrifying image: a ship – a colossal, skeletal vessel, swallowed by a crimson nebula.

JAX
(His voice low)
The Crimson Dust… it wasn't just a legend. It holds the truth.

**Scene 5:** INT. SALVAGE SHIP - LATER

SOUND:  Low humming, the rhythmic grinding of metal, a faint, unsettling melody.

Lena is staring out the viewport at the storm-ravaged expanse of space. She’s shown a heavily encrypted file – a fragmented map of the Crimson Nebula, overlaid with coordinates.

LENA
(Quietly)
The Whisper Carriers weren’t lost. They were *transferred*. To a dimension beyond space and time. And they’ve been waiting. For a signal. A signal *we* sent.

JAX
(Looking at her, a grim acceptance in his eyes)
The Lost Signals… that was all we were supposed to find.  

VOLKOV
(Standing over them, hands on his hips)
It seems our salvage operation just got a whole lot more complicated. We’ve stumbled upon something that shouldn’t exist.  Something… profoundly dangerous. 

The holographic display suddenly cuts out, plunging the ship into darkness.

LENA
(Her voice trembling)
What’s happening?

The screen flickers to life, displaying one final, chilling image – a single, perfectly formed spiral – contained within a swirling, crimson nebula, utterly consuming the light.

**Fade to Black.**

**Notes & Considerations:**

*   **The Missing "7-9" Fragments:**  This episode heavily relies on the mystery and setting of the Lost Signals. The fragmented nature emphasizes the long-term consequences of the Collapse and hints at a larger, more complex history.  The Crimson Nebula is a key symbolic element tying into themes of temporal anomalies and lost civilizations.
*   **Character Dynamics:** Jax’s cynicism, Lena’s meticulousness and intellectual drive, and Liam’s idealism provide a good balance of character arcs within the setting. Volkov's gruff demeanor suggests a cautious and secretive leadership.
*   **Political Intrigue:** The implication of a ‘lost signal’ adds a layer of mystery. The factions existing within the setting will be key. Think of a shadowy group (perhaps an ancient Martian cult) obsessed with controlling the Echoes, and a remnant of the original Collapse organization who now seeks to prevent any further activation of the lost technology.
*   **The “Echoes” as a Metaphor:**  The Echoes should be expanded upon throughout the episode – they become a conduit for memories, a source of knowledge, and potentially a gateway.
*   **Visuals:** The episode leans heavily into visually striking visuals. The Crimson Dust, the alien landscape, and the visual distortions caused by the Echoes are crucial elements for establishing the tone and atmosphere.
*   **Sound Design:** Crucially, the episode should feel like a living, breathing piece of the Expanse universe. The static, the wind, the layered sounds of the Echoes, and the rhythmic chanting will all reinforce the sense of a world in
